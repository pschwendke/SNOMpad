# trion-data
This package contains tools designed to work with the TRION data.

The acquired variables can be divided in two categories: fast-scan and 
slow-scan. Fast scan data varies at every laser shot. The fast-scan variables 
must be acquired simultaneously at every laser shot, yielding a dense table. 
The fast-scan are the optical signals, the modulation signals and the chopper
status. The slow-scan variables are varied imperatively by the acquisition
controller. They do not vary shot-to-shot. The slow-scan variables are
the AFM positions, pump-probe delay and interferometer position in spectroscopy
mode.
